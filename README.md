# Eyethereum_Public

For my final project, I developed a full-stack, blockchain-based web application called Eyethereum, with two core features: a token checker and a wallet tracker.
The final product is deployed with Vercel at: https://eyethereum.vercel.app/
A video demonstration of Eyethereum is deployed on YouTube at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCr_dQFMs3Y

After the project has been marked I will share the code on this public repository.

## Try Out The Token Checker!
Follow these instructions if you wish to test out the token checker feature yourself:

Copy this Ethereum token contract address: 0xa735a3af76cc30791c61c10d585833829d36cbe0
Open Eyethereum and sign in using your preffered email address.
Click on the Token Checker page.
Paste the contract address into the text box, and click the 'Fetch Token Data' button.
Wait for results to load.

If you wish to compare Eyethereum's results to leading competitors, copy and paste the same contract address into the following websites:
