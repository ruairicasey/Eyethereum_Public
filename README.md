# Eyethereum_Public

For my final project, I developed a full-stack, blockchain-based web application called Eyethereum, with two core features: a token checker and a wallet tracker.
The final product is deployed with Vercel at: https://eyethereum.vercel.app/
A video demonstration of Eyethereum is deployed on YouTube at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCr_dQFMs3Y

After the project has been marked I will share the code on this public repository.

Please feel free to read through my accompanying academic dissertation.

## Try Out The Token Checker!
Follow these instructions if you wish to test out the token checker feature yourself:

- Copy this Ethereum token (ERC-20) contract address: 0xa735a3af76cc30791c61c10d585833829d36cbe0
- Open Eyethereum and sign in using your preffered email address.
- Click on the Token Checker page.
- Paste the contract address into the text box, and click the 'Fetch Token Data' button.
- Wait for results to load.

If you wish to compare Eyethereum's results to leading competitors, copy and paste the same contract address into the following websites:

https://tokensniffer.com/

## Try Out The Wallet Tracker!

Follow these instructions if you wish to test out the wallet tracker feature yourself:

- Click 'Create Pool'
- Paste your Ethereum wallet address into the text box and click 'Add Wallet'
- Click 'Enable Tracking'
- Make a test transaction from your wallet, this can be either: an ETH transfer, an ERC-20 transfer, or a swap on Uniswap V2
- Wait for the results to display

Thank you!
